                <strong>Please Note:</strong><br/>
                Although our estimates are generally free of charge and obligation, we regret that a charge of &pound;85 
                is applicable for estimates relating to surveys of a property that a client is buying if contracts 
                have not been exchanged. 
                <br/><br/>
                This is fully refundable on acceptance of any work we subsequently carry out.
